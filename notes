Notes for fjostTranslate

To do
*****

1. You need to get the names of all data sets and place in them in a data file
2. For each translate function, instead of placing all the names within a rename function, 
    create a method to lookup names from data in #1 and rename to english based off of that
3. Do the same or similar for fj_translate function
